[h1]Erchius Outbreak 0.1.0[/h1]
is a rich, lore-centric content mod that aims to fill the gaps left by the huge implications surrounding erchius - what it is, where it came from, and what exactly it's doing now - that were left almost completely unexplored by the base game.

The universe was shaken with the return of the Ruin. In an instant, all eyes turned towards a single location, prompting individual and collective responses faster than had ever been seen since the early days of galactic expansion. Everyone - whether malicious or sympathetic - had their resolve and endurance tested in that one moment.
And yet, no attention was paid to one backstage actor. Who would think to look at those innocuous purple crystals, always locked far away from the general public?

All of that changes now.

Fresh out of the shadows and determined to make their mark, the Quasar Initiative puts itself directly into the limelight. This underdog, merely a group of rejects from all walks of life, is now the final bastion against a nigh unstoppable universal threat. Where the morals of others would crumble at the promise of potential profits, the Quasar spread a simple but profound message: the erchius phage _can_ be stopped, and they will not stand for the heinous cover-ups of the Letheia Corporation.
However, they are but a speck in the grand scheme of things. Effectively operating as a startup, they rely on fragmented Ancient research and a few (thankfully quite generous) sponsors. They need all the help they can get. You, my curious little crystalline defect...
...might just be exactly what they need.

You stand at the brink of either apotheosis or extinction. Don't disappoint, now... There are no second chances anymore.
