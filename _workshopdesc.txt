[h1]Erchius Epidemic 1.0.0[/h1]
is a rich, lore-centric content mod that aims to fill the gaps left by the huge implications surrounding erchius - what it is, where it came from, and what exactly it's doing now - that were left almost completely unexplored by the base game.

The galaxy was shaken with the return of the Ruin.
In an instant, all eyes turned towards a single location, prompting individual and collective responses faster than had ever been seen since the early days of galactic expansion. Everyone - whether malicious, sympathetic, or indifferent - had their resolve and endurance tested in that one moment, for no one was spared from its effects.
Yet, in the ensuing rush, no attention was paid to one backstage actor, the one key factor that could've ended everything early. Who would think to even consider those innocuous purple crystals, always locked far away from the general eye?

In any case, it's too late. All of that must change now - for better, or for worse.

Fresh out of the shadows and determined to make their mark, the Quasar Initiative puts itself directly into the limelight. This underdog, though merely a group of rejects from the darkest corporate corners, is now the final bastion against a nigh unstoppable universal threat. Where the morals of others would crumble at the promise of astronomical profits, the Quasar spread a simple but profound message: nothing will matter if the universe is consumed by the sudden erchius epidemic. But its root, the phage, can be stopped, and the heinous cover-ups of the Letheia Corporation serve only to waste valuable time, and enshroud critical information.
Alas, they are but a tiny speck in the grand scheme of politics, and smaller still in the uncaring universe around it all. Effectively a startup, they rely almost entirely on the fragmented and only partially-decoded research of our great ancestors - the Ancients - for leads into the origins of erchius. Beyond that, a handful of (thankfully quite generous) sponsors are their only fuel to follow these leads, most motivated only by the promise of usurping Letheia. They need all the help they can get. And you might just be exactly what they need.

You stand at the brink of either apotheosis or extinction. Don't disappoint... There are no second chances anymore.

The mod's goal is to be a highly enriching experience, without being a complete departure from the base game's themes. Whether you're invested in our interpretation of the narrative blanks left behind, or just looking to amp up your playthroughs with a healthy dose of imaginative worlds and powerful gear, this mod packs something for everyone with:
[*]An expansive secondary plot serving as a counterpart to the main Ruin questline
[*]An erchius-themed race complete with its own ship, racially-themed mainline armors and weapons, and racial mech bodies
[*]The "Quasar Initiative" themed faction and associated modded outpost
[*]2 new planet types, with unique weather
[*]Many weapons and tools, and several new armor sets
[*]Ancient, Erchius, and Quasar-themed cosmetics
[*]A custom collection for the mod's monsters and bugs
[*]Several new NPCs to talk to and buy from
[*]An expansive block and object list for the aspiring or experienced builder
[*]Mysterious new microdungeons
[*]Challenging instance missions
[*]And a brewing danger, hiding in plain sight
